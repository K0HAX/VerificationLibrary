VerificationLibrary is a reference implementation and library for C# RSA signature based license key verification for .NET applications.

-- KeyGen --
This is a tool to create the RSA key pair used for the rest of the application.
The output of this tool is an XML string that has all of the RSA parameters required to sign and verify licenses.

-- LicenseGen --
This is a tool to generate licenses based on the machine fingerprint provided by applications, or LicenseVerifier.
You must update PrivateKey.cs using KeyGen to make this secure.

-- LicenseVerifier --
This is a tool to test the implementation, it generates a machine fingerprint and verifies license signatures.
You must update PublicKey.cs for this to work properly.

-- VerificationLib --
This is the library that you can use in your own implementations.
I suggest you go over the solution to see how it is best implemented. It contains some helper functions as well.
